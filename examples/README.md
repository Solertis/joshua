Joshua features. If you have any comments or questions please submit

The decoding examples and model training examples in the subdirectories of this
directory assume you have downloaded the Fisher Spanish--English dataset, which
contains speech-recognizer output paired with English translations. This data
can be downloaded by running the [download.sh](https://github.com/apache/incubator-joshua/blob/master/examples/download.sh) script.
