The Joshua decoder has become an official Apache Incubator project.
The new official repository location has therefore been relocated to

    https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-joshua.git

This is mirrored to Github at the following location:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-joshua

The Joshua website has also been moved to:

    http://joshua.incubator.apache.org
