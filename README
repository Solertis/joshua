The Joshua decoder has become an official Apache Incubator project.
The new official repository location has therefore been relocated to

    https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-joshua.git

This is mirrored to Github at the following location:

    https://github.com/apache/incubator-joshua

The Joshua website continues to be hosted at

    http://joshua-decoder.org

but will be moved to the Apache incubator domain in the near future.
